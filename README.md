Musclefoods Vending Machine Kata

I have written the test application in TypeScript and setup a test bed using mocha and chai.

To run the application, run the command npm install in the root directory. Once the install has completed, you can run the test bed with npm run test.

I ran out of time near the end so unable to complete the entire kata in the time allotted. I did in fact role over the 2 hours.
